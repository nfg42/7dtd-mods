Added player crafable "Insecure Storage crates" that looks like other objects. 
So you can store your cement in a pile of cement, gas in a pump, etc.
All objects act just like an Insecure Storage crate, so they are under the WoodFurnitureBlock menu and are repaired with wood. 

Idea based on "Vanilla Expanded - Storage" from TSBX
